    Welcome!

    This is the interface you'll be using to draw structures for the next problem.
    The <span style="color: #e14a4e; font-weight: 700;"> red arrows </span> show the load that your structure will have to support.

    The <span style="color: #2eabe2; font-weight: 700;"> blue triangles </span> are where your structure will anchor to the ground.

    Your task is to design the structure that will connect those<span style="color: #e14a4e; font-weight: 700;"> red circles </span> to the <span style="color: #2eabe2; font-weight: 700;"> blue triangles </span> to support the load.

    Your goal is to do so with the least possible material, as represented in the top bar by the cost to build your current structure.

    Because the loads are totally unsupported, the current cost is the rather expensive <span style="font-weight: 700;">$&infin;</span>.

    Let's fix that:
